.. _Modularization:

Modularization
**************

Module and Interfaces
=====================

Implementing runtime polymorphism.

A module of data plane application will more resemble that of a module
inside an monolithic kernel design such as Linux, rather than an
application sitting on top of the UNIX system call boundary.

Layering and Dependency Inversion
=================================

Modular Deployment
==================

Shared objects, linking and initialization.
