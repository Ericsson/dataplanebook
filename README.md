# Data Plane Software Design

This Git repository is planned to hold a book tentatively titled *Data
Plane Software Design*, in source form.

Currently, there is nothing here.

## Source Format

The book uses the [Sphinx](https://www.sphinx-doc.org/) toolkit. The
source format is reStructuredText (RST).

## Dependencies

The author is using Sphinx v1.8.5, but it may well be the case other
versions work as well.

Please refer to the Sphinx documentation for dependencies Sphinx may
have in turn (e.g., LaTeX for PDF generation).

## Build

Run
`make html`
to generate the book in HTML format.

Run
`make help`
for other options.
