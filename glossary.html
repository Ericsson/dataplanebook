<dl class="glossary docutils">
<dt id="term-acl">ACL</dt>
<dd>An Access Control List (ACL) regulates access to a resource. In
data plane applications, ACLs usually have a match part,
where the user specifies which packets this rule should apply to,
and an action part, which specifies what should be done to
matching packet (e.g., drop or accept).</dd>
<dt id="term-amdahl-s-law">Amdahl’s law</dt>
<dd>Amdahl’s law gives the theoretical performance gains
(in terms of reduced <a class="reference internal" href="#term-processing-latency"><span class="xref std std-term">processing latency</span></a>) when multiple
processors are used to complete a partly parallel task.</dd>
<dt id="term-atm">ATM</dt>
<dd>Asynchronous Transfer Mode (ATM) is a type of fixed (wired)
telecommunications network, that has largely fallen into disuse.
As opposed to IP, ATM is connection-oriented on the data link layer.</dd>
<dt id="term-bgp">BGP</dt>
<dd>The Border Gateway Protocol (BGP) is a protocol used by Internet
routers to exchange routing and reachability information.</dd>
<dt id="term-data-plane-platform">Data plane platform</dt>
<dd>The part of the data plane applications that provides hardware
abstractions and the assoicated hardware drivers, and other
operating system-like services like work scheduling, memory
management, and timers. <a class="reference internal" href="intro.html#dpdk"><span class="std std-ref">Data Plane Development Kit</span></a> is the reference data
plane platform of this book.</dd>
<dt id="term-communications-processor">Communications Processor</dt>
<dd>An older name for a <a class="reference internal" href="#term-dpu"><span class="xref std std-term">DPU</span></a>.</dd>
<dt id="term-control-plane"><a class="reference internal" href="intro.html#control-plane"><span class="std std-ref">Control plane</span></a></dt>
<dd>The part of the network that negiotates, computes or otherwise handles
higher-level policies, such as how routing is set up, and makes sure
they take affect in the Data Plane.</dd>
<dt id="term-control-thread"><a class="reference internal" href="intro.html#control-threads"><span class="std std-ref">Control thread</span></a></dt>
<dd>A control thread is a thread running as a part fast path process,
responsible for serving process-external interfaces, translating
requests into calls into the fast path’s internal APIs. Unlike
their lcore worker thread counterparts, the control threads usually
don’t run on dedicated CPU cores.</dd>
<dt id="term-cn">CN</dt>
<dd>The Core Network (CN) is the network that sits between the <a class="reference internal" href="#term-ran"><span class="xref std std-term">RAN</span></a>
and the Internet in a mobile telecommunications system, such as LTE.</dd>
<dt id="term-data-plane"><a class="reference internal" href="intro.html#data-plane"><span class="std std-ref">Data plane</span></a></dt>
<dd>The part of the network that handles that actual user data. Also known
as the User Plane, or the Forwarding Plane.</dd>
<dt id="term-data-plane-control"><a class="reference internal" href="intro.html#data-plane-control"><span class="std std-ref">Data plane control</span></a></dt>
<dd>The part of the data plane application that terminates
interfaces external to the network function (e.g., for
configuration or observability).</dd>
<dt id="term-critical-section">Critical section</dt>
<dd>Critical section (also known as <em>critical region</em>) is a section
of the program which cannot be executed by more than one thread
in parallel. This may be achived by means of a lock.</dd>
<dt id="term-domain-logic">Domain logic</dt>
<dd>Domain logic, also known as <em>business logic</em>, is the part of
a program that directly correspond to it’s core function. For
a network stack, it’s the part the implements the protocol
processing logic. For example, in an IP stack generating a ICMP
Time Exceeded when the Time to Live (TTL) has reached 0 is
domain logic. The part of the stack responsible to retrieve
the packet via the Ethernet driver is not.</dd>
<dt id="term-dpu">DPU</dt>
<dd>A Data Processing Unit (DPU) is processor designed for data
plane applications. A DPU is built around a complex of
general-purpose CPU cores, augmented by networking-specific
accelerators and high performance network I/O interfaces.
Older processor generations with the same basic architecture
was referred to as communication processors.</dd>
<dt id="term-exception-traffic">Exception traffic</dt>
<dd>Exception traffic consists of packets, which during normal
network conditions are unusual, that for some reason need more
complex processing. For flow-based forwarding engines, this
could be the first packet in a previously unseen flow, and as
such requires checking against security policies and the
installation of a new entry in the fast path’s forwarding
database. It may also be an ARP request, or a fragmented IP
packet, for a limited-feature fast path IP stack.</dd>
<dt id="term-false-sharing">False sharing</dt>
<dd>False sharing occurs when multiple CPU cores accesses two or
more pieces of logically disjoint data resides on the same CPU
cache line. For false sharing to have any detrimental effects,
at least one core need to write to the cache line. The effect is
a performance degradation, the size of which depends on the
frequency of access. False sharing does not affect the
correctness of the program.</dd>
<dt id="term-fast-path"><a class="reference internal" href="intro.html#fast-path"><span class="std std-ref">Fast path</span></a></dt>
<dd>The dataplane fast path is part of the data plane application that
handles the bulk of the packets.</dd>
<dt id="term-fib">FIB</dt>
<dd>A Forward Information Base (FIB) holds information on where to
forward a packet.</dd>
<dt id="term-flow-cache">Flow cache</dt>
<dd>A flow cache is a data structure which is logically an overlay
on top of the complete <a class="reference internal" href="#term-fib"><span class="xref std std-term">FIB</span></a>. Systems that employ a
flow cache avoid having to perform a potentially costly FIB lookup
(among other processing, such as <a class="reference internal" href="#term-acl"><span class="xref std std-term">ACL</span></a> lookups) for every
packet in a flow.</dd>
<dt id="term-forwarding-plane">Forwarding plane</dt>
<dd>A synonym to data plane, often used for in the context of switches
and IP router implementations.</dd>
<dt id="term-high-touch-application">High touch application</dt>
<dd>A data plane fast path application that on average spends relativily
many CPU clock cycles and other hardware resources for every packet.</dd>
<dt id="term-huge-pages">Huge Pages</dt>
<dd>The virtual address space is divided into pages, usually 4 kB
in size. The hardware keeps a cache of translation between
virtual and physical in a Translation Look-aside Buffer (TLB).
For applications accessing a large amount of memory (i.e., with
a large working set size), the TLB cache may be missed, causing
expensive traps to the kernel. Increasing the page size for
part of the virtual memory is a way to avoid this issue. Such
pages are often very much large (e.g., 2 MB or 1 GB), and thus
are often referred to as “huge pages”.</dd>
<dt id="term-isa">ISA</dt>
<dd>An Instruction Set Architecture (ISA) specifies the interface
between software and the CPU hardware. The ISA defines things like
the available machine language instructions (and how they
are encoded), registers, data types and memory models.</dd>
<dt id="term-layer-2">Layer 2</dt>
<dd>The data link layer is the second layer in OSI model, and handles
data transmission between different nodes on the same physical
network segment. Ethernet is an example of a layer 2 data link
layer protocol.</dd>
<dt id="term-lcore">Lcore</dt>
<dd>Short for logical core. Lcore is a term extensively used in DPDK,
and means something that looks like a CPU core from a software
point of view, and is allocated to the DPDK application (via a core
mask). In a bare metal system, a logical core is either a “full”
physical core (for non-SMT systems) or a hardware thread (for cases
where hardware threading is employed).</dd>
<dt id="term-lcore-worker-thread">Lcore worker thread</dt>
<dd>An operating system software thread responsible for processing packets
for the data plane fast path. This thread is pinned to a particular
by DPDK, and should be the only thread scheduled on that lcore.</dd>
<dt id="term-load">Load</dt>
<dd>A load machine instruction reads a chunk of data (usually 8-512
bits) from memory and puts it into a CPU register.</dd>
<dt id="term-low-touch-application">Low touch application</dt>
<dd>A data plane fast path application that on average spends relativily
few CPU clock cycles and other hardware resources for every packet.</dd>
<dt id="term-lto">LTO</dt>
<dd>Link-time Optimization (LTO) is a compiler mode of operation,
where optimizations are deferred to the link stage, allowing
optimization to be done across program’s or shared library’s
different compilation units. The inlining of a function residing
in a different .c file than the caller is possible, for
example. LTO increases build times to such a large degree that
it is often impractical to use.</dd>
<dt id="term-mib">MIB</dt>
<dd>A Management Information Base (MIB) is a <a class="reference internal" href="#term-snmp"><span class="xref std std-term">SNMP</span></a> data model.
The term is sometimes also used to refer to an instance of a
particular model. IEFT has defined a number of MIBs (e.g., for
TCP and IP).</dd>
<dt id="term-management-plane"><a class="reference internal" href="intro.html#management-plane"><span class="std std-ref">Management plane</span></a></dt>
<dd>The part of the network that handles configuration and
monitoring.</dd>
<dt id="term-nat">NAT</dt>
<dd>Network Address Translation (NAT) is a method of rewriting the
IP packet header to translate to change the source and/or
destination host and/or port, often for the purpose of having
multiple IP hosts to between host’s and its single IP address.</dd>
<dt id="term-netconf">NETCONF</dt>
<dd>The Network Configuration Protocol (NETCONF) is an XML-based
network configuration management protocol developed by the IEFT.</dd>
<dt id="term-network-function">Network function</dt>
<dd>For the purpose of this book, the immediate surroundings to the
data plane application, which work in concert to provide a data
plane function to interface with the control plane and other
instances of data plane functions.</dd>
<dt id="term-network-protocol-suite">Network protocol suite</dt>
<dd>A set of related communication protocols, usually arranged in
layered architecture, used in a computer network.</dd>
<dt id="term-network-stack">Network stack</dt>
<dd>A network stack, also known as a protocol stack, is an
implemention, usually in software, of a family or
<a class="reference internal" href="#term-network-protocol-suite"><span class="xref std std-term">suite</span></a> of network protocols.</dd>
<dt id="term-mythical-man-month">Mythical Man-Month</dt>
<dd>In the book titled <em>The Mythical Man-Month: Essays on Software
Engineering</em>, Fredrick Brooks of IBM debunks the myth that a
software project can be estimated in man months. In particular,
he observes that the communcation overhead grows in non-linear
fashion as people are added to the project.</dd>
<dt id="term-preemption-safety">Preemption Safety</dt>
<dd>A operation is preemption safe in case the preemption of a
thread’s execution (e.g., a kernel-induced process context
switch occurs) does not threaten the correctness of the program,
or have very detrimental effects performance. In this book, the
preemption unsafe constructs covered only cause performance
degradation, although at time very serious such.</dd>
<dt id="term-processing-latency">Processing Latency</dt>
<dd><p class="first">For the purpose of this book, processing latency is the CPU time
spent on a particular task (i.e., the number of CPU core
cycles).  In case the processing is performed on multiple cores
in parallel, the processing latency may be greater than the
<a class="reference internal" href="#term-wall-clock-latency"><span class="xref std std-term">wall-clock latency</span></a>. In case a packet is buffered (e.g.,
on the NIC), and the data plane CPU cores are very busy, the
processing latency may be only a small fraction of the total
port-to-port wall-clock latency experience by that packet.</p>
<p class="last">In the context of IP routers, the term is used to denote all
latency that occurs within the router (i.e., both CPU related
latency and internal queuing latency). This is not how the term
is used in this book.</p>
</dd>
<dt id="term-program-order">Program order</dt>
<dd>Operations are said to be done in program order if their results
are globally visible in the same order as the operations were
specified in the program’s source code.</dd>
<dt id="term-ran">RAN</dt>
<dd>The Radio Access Network (RAN) is the network that sits between
the <a class="reference internal" href="#term-ue"><span class="xref std std-term">UE</span></a> and the <a class="reference internal" href="#term-cn"><span class="xref std std-term">CN</span></a> in a mobile telecommuncations
system.</dd>
<dt id="term-rfs">RFS</dt>
<dd>See <a class="reference internal" href="#term-rss"><span class="xref std std-term">RSS</span></a>.</dd>
<dt id="term-rss">RSS</dt>
<dd>Receive Side Scaling. A NIC function which distributes packets
to different NIC RX descriptor queues, usually based on the
source and destination IP. If transport layer fields are taken
into a account, the same function is sometimes called
Receive Flow Scaling (RFS).</dd>
<dt id="term-slow-path">Slow path</dt>
<dd>The part of a data plane application that process exception traffic.</dd>
<dt id="term-sequence-counter">Sequence counter</dt>
<dd>A sequence counter is a low-overhead reader-writer synchronization
mechanism.</dd>
<dt id="term-snmp">SNMP</dt>
<dd>The Simple Network Management Protocol is a network management
protocol for IP networks. Originally intended for configuration
management, current-day use is primarily for network monitoring.</dd>
<dt id="term-spinlock">Spinlock</dt>
<dd>A type of lock where a thread failing to acquire a lock
immediately retries, and keeps doing so (“spins”), until the
lock operation is successful. Spinlocks are common in operating
systems kernels, but unusual in user space applications, since
they are not <a class="reference internal" href="#term-preemption-safety"><span class="xref std std-term">preemption safe</span></a>.</dd>
<dt id="term-ssh">SSH</dt>
<dd>Secure Shell (SSH) is a protocol for remote shell access and
command execution. It may also be used as a secure transport
layer (e.g., for <a class="reference internal" href="#term-netconf"><span class="xref std std-term">NETCONF</span></a>).</dd>
<dt id="term-store">Store</dt>
<dd>A store machine instruction takes the contents of a CPU register
(usually 8-512 bits of data) and writes it into memory.</dd>
<dt id="term-syslog">Syslog</dt>
<dd>Long the de facto standard logging standard on UNIX systems,
syslog is now specified (or more accurately, documented) in IEFT
<a class="reference external" href="https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc5424.txt">RFC 5424</a>.</dd>
<dt id="term-tls">TLS</dt>
<dd>In C11, and long before in GNU C, a static or extern storage
class variable may be declared as being kept in Thread Local
Storage (TLS). Such variables exists in one copy per thread in
the process. C11 uses <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">thread_local</span></code> to mark a variable thread
local, but in DPDK the practice is to instead use the GCC
extensions <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">__thread</span></code>.</dd>
<dt id="term-ue">UE</dt>
<dd>User Equipment (UE) is 3GPP term for a mobile terminal. A UE is
roughly equivalent of a <em>host</em> in a TCP/IP network. To complicate
things, a UE is also almost always a <em>host</em> as well, since the
mobile network is used as a data link layer for IP.</dd>
<dt id="term-user-plane">User plane</dt>
<dd>A synonym to <a class="reference internal" href="#term-data-plane"><span class="xref std std-term">data plane</span></a>, commonly used in the context of
telecommunications networks.</dd>
<dt id="term-vector-packet-processing">Vector packet processing</dt>
<dd><p class="first">Vector packet processing is a network stack design pattern,
where the packets traverse the different layers in network stack
in batches (“vectors”), rather than as individual packets. The
implementation-level layers may coorelate with the layers of the
<a class="reference internal" href="#term-network-protocol-suite"><span class="xref std std-term">network protocol suite</span></a> being implemented, but may also
be more fine-grained (e.g., IP processing may be split into two
or three such “sub layers”), or just different altogheter. In a
traditional network stack, a packet traverse the whole stack up
until completion (e.g., the packet is dropped, forwarded, or
handed off to a local application).</p>
<p>The benefit of vector packet processing is reduced instruction
cache pressure, and improve temporal locality for data related
to a particular layer. It also reduces the number of required
function calls. A drawback is that the reduced readability and
an increase in code complexity, especially if manual loop
unrolling is used.</p>
<p>Besides vector packet processing is passing vectors of packets
between layers, the sub layer processing code allows the
compiler to use SIMD instructions to a much higher degree that
would be possible in a single-packet-per-layer design.</p>
<p class="last">One prominent use of the Vector packet processing pattern is the
Open Source network router and switch platform with the same
name - <a class="reference external" href="http://fd.io/">Vector Packet Processing</a></p>
</dd>
<dt id="term-wall-clock-latency">Wall-clock Latency</dt>
<dd>Wall-clock latency, or wall-time latency, is the latency in
terms of the passage of physical time (i.e., what a wall clock
measures). A commonly used synonym (e.g., in the context of
manufacturing) is <em>lead time</em>. The wall-clock latency may be
longer or shorter than the <a class="reference internal" href="#term-processing-latency"><span class="xref std std-term">processing latency</span></a>.</dd>
<dt id="term-work-scheduler">Work scheduler</dt>
<dd>For the purpose of this book, a work scheduler (also known as a
job scheduler) is a data plane fast path function that assign
items of work to the worker lcores. Work scheduling in its
simpliest forms can be the use of <a class="reference internal" href="#term-rss"><span class="xref std std-term">RSS</span></a> in the NIC. A DPDK
Event Device is a form of work scheduler. In a data plane
application, a job is usually, but not always, processing a
packet (at a certain stage in the pipeline, or the complete
processing, for run-to-completion designs).</dd>
<dt id="term-working-set-size">Working set size</dt>
<dd>The amount of memory actively being used by a program, as opposed
to memory merely allocated, and then left unused. This book will
used this term to denote <em>actively used</em> to mean memory that is
being repeatedly and oftenly used, as opposed to memory that
is only rarely used (e.g., during initialization). The reason for
this definition is that the primary use for the term is in the
context of CPU cache pressure. The total amount of memory ever
used by the application is usually less of a concearn, for these
types of applications. The working set includes both instructions
and data.</dd>
